    <h1>The Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, pastry named for its crescent shape.
      Croissants are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is
      layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
      rolled into a sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results
      in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped
      breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes
      possibly since antiquity. Croissants have long been a staple of Austrian
      and French bakeries and pâtisseries. In the late 1970s, the development of
      factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but unbaked dough made them into a fast
      food which can be freshly baked by unskilled labor.
